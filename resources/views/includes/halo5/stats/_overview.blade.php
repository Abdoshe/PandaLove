    The graphs here are updated nightly at 22:00 UTC (4pm CST). If your character has not played
    Halo in 10 days, then it will be marked as inactive and thus not updated.
    <br /><br />
    Please ensure that you issue a <strong>/bot h5</strong> command in chat when you start playing again.
    If your stats change from the result of that command, you will no longer be marked as inactive.
