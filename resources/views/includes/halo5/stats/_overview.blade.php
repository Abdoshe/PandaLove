<div class="ui info message">
    If your character has not played Halo in 10 days, then it will be marked as inactive and thus not updated.
    <br /><br />
    Please ensure that you issue a <strong>/bot h5</strong> command in chat when you start playing again.
    If your stats change from the result of that command, you will no longer be marked as inactive.
    <br /><br />
    This data will be updated in: <strong>{{ $timeLeft }}</strong>.
